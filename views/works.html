        <ul>
            
            <li>"I want to make babies with her [Brienne of Tarth]. Think of them... great big monsters. They'd conquer the world."</li>
            <li>"You have to keep moving, that's the secret. Walking's good, fighting's better, f*cking's best."</li>
            <li>"Before the sun comes up tomorrow. The big woman still here?"</li>
            <li>"They call me 'Giantsbane.' Want to know why? I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."</li>
            <li>"Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire."</li>
            <li>“You need to be patient. Give her time. Your c*ck shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal.”</li>
            <li>"I've always had blue eyes!"</li>
        </ul>
